# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a space in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X or O). This implementation allows players to play against each other or against an AI bot with adjustable difficulty levels. The bot uses strategic algorithms to provide a challenging experience.

### Library Structure
The project is organized into the following key components:

- **GameLogic.swift**: Contains the core game logic, including the rules of Tic Tac Toe, AI decision-making, and game state management. This file handles player moves, checks for winners, and implements the AI's behavior based on the selected difficulty level.

- **ContentView.swift**: The main user interface of the application, built using SwiftUI. This file defines the layout of the game board, handles user interactions, and displays the current game state, including scores and messages.

- **Persistence.swift**: Manages data persistence using Core Data, allowing for future enhancements such as saving game history or player statistics.

- **Assets.xcassets**: Contains image assets and color sets used in the application, ensuring a visually appealing design.

- **Supporting Files**: Includes project configuration files, such as the Info.plist and project settings, which are necessary for the app's functionality.

## Tech Stack
This project is built using the following technologies:

- **Swift**: The primary programming language used for developing the application, providing a modern and safe coding experience.

- **SwiftUI**: A user interface toolkit that allows for declarative UI design, making it easy to create responsive and dynamic interfaces.

- **Core Data**: A framework used for data management and persistence, allowing for the storage of game data and player statistics.

- **Xcode**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for building and testing the application, providing tools for debugging and performance analysis.

## Features
- **Two Game Modes**: Play against a friend or an AI bot.
- **Adjustable AI Difficulty**: Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty levels for the AI.
